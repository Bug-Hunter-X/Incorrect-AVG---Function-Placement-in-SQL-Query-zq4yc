This repository contains a common SQL error involving the incorrect placement of the AVG() aggregate function within a WHERE clause. The original query attempts to filter employees based on a salary greater than the average, but the AVG() function is incorrectly placed, leading to an error. The solution demonstrates the correct way to use a subquery or common table expression (CTE) to calculate the average salary first and then use it in the WHERE clause for filtering.
